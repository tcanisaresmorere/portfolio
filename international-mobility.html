            <h2>International Mobility</h2>
            <p>Traveling has played an important role in my education, as it allowed me to experience new cultures, 
            practice foreign languages, and broaden my perspective of the world.  
            Here are some of the destinations I've had the chance to explore:</p>

            <div class="course-section">
                <h3>🇬🇧 England</h3>
                <p>I visited part of southern England, including London and Stonehenge, 
                as part of a language trip. I lived with local people, which gave me the opportunity 
                to improve my English and discover British culture from the inside.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="course-section">
                <h3>🇪🇸 Spain</h3>
                <p>I have traveled to Spain several times and discovered different regions of this beautiful country.  
                I visited Girona twice, a city I really enjoyed.  
                I also went to Valencia, where I explored the impressive City of Arts and Sciences.  
                With my family, I discovered Asturias, especially Gijón and its surroundings.  
                Finally, we traveled down to Salamanca, where I was able to practice speaking Spanish 
                with locals, which was a very rewarding experience.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="course-section">
                <h3>🇮🇹 Italy</h3>
                <p>With my family, I was lucky enough to visit different regions of Italy: 
                the Cinque Terre (Five Lands), Florence, and Pisa.  
                This trip was full of discoveries, from history and architecture to food and culture.  
                I learned so much, and I am sure I will never forget this experience.
