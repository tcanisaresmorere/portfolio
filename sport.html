      <h2>Sport & Other Activities</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond my academic and professional path, I cultivate several passions that contribute to my personal growth, balance, and creativity.
      </p>

      <!-- Judo -->
      <section class="course-section">
        <h3>🥋 Judo & Martial Arts</h3>
        <p>
          I have been practicing <strong>judo for more than 12 years</strong>, which has taught me discipline,
          perseverance, and respect. More generally, I am passionate about martial arts and combat sports.
          These practices have helped me develop both physical endurance and mental strength, qualities that
          I carry into my academic and professional life.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the world of judo, I particularly admire <strong>Teddy Riner</strong>, whose career and mindset
          are a true source of inspiration for me.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Cooking -->
      <section class="course-section">
        <h3>🍳 Cooking</h3>
        <p>
          Cooking is another passion of mine. I enjoy experimenting with new recipes and techniques, as well
          as sharing meals with family and friends. It is both a creative outlet and a way to bring people together.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I had to pick just one dish as my favorite, it would definitely be <strong>lasagna</strong>,
          a meal that combines flavor, comfort, and conviviality.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Cinema -->
      <section class="course-section">
        <h3>🎬 Cinema</h3>
        <p>
          I also have a great interest in cinema. I appreciate the diversity of genres, from classic films to
          modern productions, and I enjoy discovering how stories are told through images, sound, and direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among all sagas, my all-time favorite is <strong>Star Wars</strong>, which has fascinated me since
          childhood with its epic storytelling, memorable characters, and vision of a galaxy far, far away.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Reading -->
      <section class="course-section">
        <h3>📚 Reading</h3>
        <p>
          Reading is one of my favorite pastimes, particularly in the field of <strong>science fiction</strong>.
          This genre allows me to explore imaginative worlds and futuristic ideas, while also reflecting on
          social and ethical questions relevant to our present and future.
        </p>
        <p>
          My favorite books are the legendary <strong>Dune</strong> novels by Frank Herbert, a saga that
          masterfully blends politics, philosophy, and adventure.
