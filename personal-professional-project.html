            <h2>Personal Professional Project (PPP)</h2>
            <p>Over time, I've realized that connecting with mentors and engaging with industry professionals 
            is one of the best ways to stay updated on the job market and its expectations. 
            To achieve this, I rely on a range of tools and strategies, particularly LinkedIn and 
            MyJobGlasses, which allow me to reach out to engineers and managers from different sectors.
            </p>

            <div class="course-section">
                <h3>Career Interests</h3>
                <p>I am open to diverse professional sectors, but two domains particularly stand out for me: 
                transportation (aeronautics and aerospace included) and finance.  
                What connects these areas is my strong interest in applied mathematics, 
                as both offer opportunities to work with algorithms, data, and optimization.
                </p>

                <p>Aeronautics and aerospace fascinate me because of their technological challenges and their 
                contribution to global mobility. This is why I first sought to interview professionals working in this sector.  
                At the same time, the finance industry also attracts me, as it combines mathematical rigor and 
                advanced computing, particularly in algorithmic trading and risk analysis.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="course-section">
                <h3>Connecting with Mentors</h3>
                <p>Thanks to MyJobGlasses, I was able to connect with professionals from leading companies.  
                I had the chance to interview Yan Frick (Head of Digital and IS, Thales Flight Line Avionics BU) 
                and Yohann P. (Engineering Delivery Manager, Thales).  
                They provided valuable insights into career opportunities, the importance of adaptability, 
                and the skills sought by major companies in the aeronautics sector.
                </p>

                    </div>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>These exchanges were very enriching and helped me better understand both the daily work of engineers 
                and the expectations of large industrial groups. They also reinforced my motivation to continue developing 
                my technical expertise and adaptability.

                <h3>Transport Industry & Internship Experience</h3>
                <p>The transportation sector fascinates me, not only because of its technological innovations 
                but also because of its strong societal impact.  
                This is one of the reasons I chose to complete my internship at TE Connectivity, 
                an international leader in connectivity and sensor solutions.
                </p>

                    <p class="caption">TE Connectivity manufacturing facility in Toulouse</p>
                </div>

                <p>At the Toulouse site, TE Connectivity manufactures a wide range of sensors, including those for 
                humidity, temperature, viscosity, fluid characteristics (such as oil), and speed measurement.  
                These applications are essential to ensure the safety, efficiency, and performance of vehicles 
                and industrial systems.  
                This internship gave me valuable insights into the transport industry and reinforced my motivation 
                to contribute to this exciting field.

                <h3>Deliverables</h3>
                <p>As part of this PPP, I produced several documents that reflect my research, interviews, and career reflections:</p>
                <ul class="skills-summary">
                    <li>CVs and cover letter templates (in French and English)</li>
                    <li>Mentor interview reports (summaries of exchanges with professionals)</li>
                    <li>Internship reports and mission summaries</li>
                    <li>Other relevant documents related to my career exploration</li>
                    <li>A PowerPoint presentation (5‚Äì8 slides) summarizing my PPP, 
                    which will also serve as a support for an oral presentation.</li>
