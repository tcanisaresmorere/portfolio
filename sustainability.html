            <h2>Sustainability & Civic Engagement</h2>
            <p>At ENSEEIHT, students are encouraged to take part in activities that raise awareness about global
            challenges and social responsibility. During my first year, I had the opportunity to participate in
            two major initiatives.</p>

            <div class="course-section">
                <h3>🌍 Climate Fresk</h3>
                <p>The Climate Fresk is a collaborative workshop designed to raise awareness
                about climate change by connecting scientific data with real-world impacts. In small groups, we
                built a visual map of the causes and consequences of global warming.  
                </p>

                <p>This activity allowed me to deepen my understanding of environmental issues. It also highlighted the role that engineers must play in
                building sustainable solutions for the future.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="course-section">
                <h3>♿ Disability Awareness Day</h3>
                <p>The Disability Awareness Day was particularly meaningful to me on a personal level.  
                Having a younger brother with autism, I have always been deeply aware of the importance of inclusion
                and understanding towards people with disabilities.  
                </p>

                <p>I strongly believe that such initiatives are a real opportunity for students, as they encourage us to
                develop empathy and openness. I am sincerely grateful that ENSEEIHT supports these values and actively
                promotes awareness of the challenges faced by people with disabilities.
