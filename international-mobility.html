      <h2>International Mobility</h2>
      <p>
        Traveling has played an important role in my education, as it allowed me to experience new cultures, 
        practice foreign languages, and broaden my perspective of the world.  
        Here are some of the destinations I’ve had the chance to explore:
      </p>

      <!-- England -->
      <section class="course-section">
        <h3>🇬🇧 England</h3>
        <p>
          I visited part of southern England, including <strong>London</strong> and <strong>Stonehenge</strong>, 
          as part of a language trip. I lived with local people, which gave me the opportunity 
          to improve my English and discover British culture from the inside.
        </p>

      <!-- Spain -->
      <section class="course-section">
        <h3>🇪🇸 Spain</h3>
        <p>
          I have traveled to Spain several times and discovered different regions of this beautiful country.  
          I visited <strong>Girona</strong> twice, a city I really enjoyed.  
          I also went to <strong>Valencia</strong>, where I explored the impressive <em>City of Arts and Sciences</em>.  
          With my family, I discovered <strong>Asturias</strong>, especially <strong>Gijón</strong> and its surroundings.  
          Finally, we traveled down to <strong>Salamanca</strong>, where I was able to practice speaking Spanish 
          with locals, which was a very rewarding experience.
        </p>

      <!-- Italy -->
      <section class="course-section">
        <h3>🇮🇹 Italy</h3>
        <p>
          With my family, I was lucky enough to visit different regions of Italy: 
          <strong>the Cinque Terre (Five Lands)</strong>, <strong>Florence</strong>, and <strong>Pisa</strong>.  
          This trip was full of discoveries, from history and architecture to food and culture.  
          I learned so much, and I am sure I will never forget this experience.
