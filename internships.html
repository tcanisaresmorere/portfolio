      <h2>Internships</h2>
  
      <p class="intro-text">
        Throughout my engineering studies, I've completed hands-on internships that bridged theoretical knowledge with real-world applications. Below, I detail my experiences, including key missions, technical contributions, and skills developed. These opportunities have honed my problem-solving abilities in manufacturing and data analysis.

        <p>
          During the summer between my first and second year at ENSEEIHT (Toulouse INP), I joined the Manufacturing Engineering team at TE Connectivity. My primary goal was to minimize false rejects on the HTGB machine, which uses an Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) camera, while also reducing overall rejects. The machine applies tin solder to PCBs (soldering 3 pins per board) and deposits silicone around the perimeter‚Äîthough my focus was solely on the soldering process.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Data collection was a key challenge: Soldering parameters (9 in total: 3 surfaces, 3 heights, 3 volumes) and the Flex Status were stored in a CSV file on the production line workstation. Meanwhile, around 40 other parameters were sent via PLC to a separate database. I unified all this data into a single table for streamlined analysis.

        </div>
    
        <p>
          In parallel, I developed Python scripts for data exploration and visualization to identify patterns in false rejects. Key scripts included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Box plots for parameter distribution analysis.</li>
          <li>Histograms and density plots, with calculations for basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, 3-sigma/6-sigma thresholds) and process capabilities (Cp and Cpk).</li>
          <li>Control charts to monitor process stability.</li>
          <li>2D scatter plots correlating surface vs. height, height vs. volume, and volume vs. surface.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
          I also explored JMP software for statistical analysis, used by the Process team. To pinpoint causes of false rejects, I created a Python tool for 2D graphical visualization of 11 key parameters. This involved Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on soldering parameters, RFID shuttle numbers, and PCB suppliers, followed by clustering with One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVM). Daily, I reviewed false reject parts from operators and AOI camera images to refine the model. With a larger dataset, this could evolve into an automated false reject detection system for the HTGB AOI.

        <p>
          Working alongside experts like H√©l√®ne Choteau and Sarah Albert, I gained deep insights into process engineering and soldering. This internship strengthened my Python and SQL programming skills, introduced me to AOI cameras and their capabilities, and emphasized data-driven manufacturing improvements.
