      <h2>Personal Professional Project (PPP)</h2>
      <p>
        Over time, I‚Äôve realized that connecting with mentors and engaging with industry professionals 
        is one of the best ways to stay updated on the job market and its expectations. 
        To achieve this, I rely on a range of tools and strategies, particularly <strong>LinkedIn</strong> and 
        <strong>MyJobGlasses</strong>, which allow me to reach out to engineers and managers from different sectors.
      </p>

      <!-- Career interests -->

        <h3>Career Interests</h3>
        <p>
          I am open to diverse professional sectors, but two domains particularly stand out for me: 
          <strong>transportation (aeronautics and aerospace included)</strong> and <strong>finance</strong>.  
          What connects these areas is my strong interest in <em>applied mathematics</em>, 
          as both offer opportunities to work with algorithms, data, and optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aeronautics and aerospace fascinate me because of their technological challenges and their 
          contribution to global mobility. This is why I first sought to interview professionals working in this sector.  
          At the same time, the finance industry also attracts me, as it combines mathematical rigor and 
          advanced computing, particularly in algorithmic trading and risk analysis.
        </p>

        <h3>Connecting with Mentors</h3>
        <p>
          Thanks to <strong>MyJobGlasses</strong>, I was able to connect with professionals from leading companies.  
          I had the chance to interview <strong>Yan Frick</strong> (Head of Digital and IS, Thales Flight Line Avionics BU) 
          and <strong>Yohann P.</strong> (Engineering Delivery Manager, Thales).  
          They provided valuable insights into career opportunities, the importance of adaptability, 
          and the skills sought by major companies in the aeronautics sector.

          These exchanges were very enriching and helped me better understand both the daily work of engineers 
          and the expectations of large industrial groups. They also reinforced my motivation to continue developing 
          my technical expertise and adaptability.

        <h3>Transport Industry & Internship Experience</h3>
        <p>
          The transportation sector fascinates me, not only because of its technological innovations 
          but also because of its strong societal impact.  
          This is one of the reasons I chose to complete my internship at <strong>TE Connectivity</strong>, 
          an international leader in connectivity and sensor solutions.
        </p>

        <div class="te-section">

          <p>
            At the Toulouse site, TE Connectivity manufactures a wide range of sensors, including those for 
            <em>humidity, temperature, viscosity, fluid characteristics (such as oil), and speed measurement</em>.  
            These applications are essential to ensure the safety, efficiency, and performance of vehicles 
            and industrial systems.  
            This internship gave me valuable insights into the transport industry and reinforced my motivation 
            to contribute to this exciting field.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>CVs and cover letter templates</strong> (in French and English)</li>
          <li><strong>Mentor interview reports</strong> (summaries of exchanges with professionals)</li>
          <li><strong>Internship reports</strong> and mission summaries</li>
          <li><strong>Other relevant documents</strong> related to my career exploration</li>
          <li>A <strong>PowerPoint presentation (5‚Äì8 slides)</strong> summarizing my PPP, 
              which will also serve as a support for an oral presentation.</li>
