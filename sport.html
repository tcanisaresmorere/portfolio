            <h2>Sport & Other Activities</h2>
            <p>Beyond my academic and professional path, I cultivate several passions that contribute to my personal growth, balance, and creativity.</p>

            <div class="course-section">
                <h3>🥋 Judo & Martial Arts</h3>
                <p>I have been practicing judo for more than 12 years, which has taught me discipline,
                perseverance, and respect. More generally, I am passionate about martial arts and combat sports.
                These practices have helped me develop both physical endurance and mental strength, qualities that
                I carry into my academic and professional life.
                </p>

                <p>In the world of judo, I particularly admire Teddy Riner, whose career and mindset
                are a true source of inspiration for me.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="course-section">
                <h3>🍳 Cooking</h3>
                <p>Cooking is another passion of mine. I enjoy experimenting with new recipes and techniques, as well
                as sharing meals with family and friends. It is both a creative outlet and a way to bring people together.
                </p>

                <p>If I had to pick just one dish as my favorite, it would definitely be lasagna,
                a meal that combines flavor, comfort, and conviviality.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="course-section">
                <h3>🎬 Cinema</h3>
                <p>I also have a great interest in cinema. I appreciate the diversity of genres, from classic films to
                modern productions, and I enjoy discovering how stories are told through images, sound, and direction.
                </p>

                <p>Among all sagas, my all-time favorite is Star Wars, which has fascinated me since
                childhood with its epic storytelling, memorable characters, and vision of a galaxy far, far away.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="course-section">
                <h3>📚 Reading</h3>
                <p>Reading is one of my favorite pastimes, particularly in the field of science fiction.
                This genre allows me to explore imaginative worlds and futuristic ideas, while also reflecting on
                social and ethical questions relevant to our present and future.
                </p>

                <p>My favorite books are the legendary Dune novels by Frank Herbert, a saga that
                masterfully blends politics, philosophy, and adventure.
